// \brief FEAT Tutorial 01: Poisson solver (TM)
//
// This file contains a simple prototypical Poisson solver for the unit square domain.
//
// The PDE to be solved reads:
//
//    -Laplace(u) = f          in the domain [0,1]x[0,1]
//             u  = 0          on the boundary
//
// The analytical solution u is given as
//
//         u(x,y) = sin(pi*x) * sin(pi*y)
//
// and its corresponding force (right-hand-side) f is
//
//         f(x,y) = 2 * pi^2 * u(x,y)
//
//
// The purpose of this tutorial is to demonstrate the basic program flow of a simple
// scalar stationary linear PDE solver without going to far into the details of what
// magic happens under-the-hood.
//
//
// The basic program flow of this application is as follows:
//
// 1. Define the required types for spatial discretisation and linear algebra.
//
// 2. Create a mesh and a boundary mesh-part by using a factory.
//
// 3. Create a trafo based on the mesh and a finite element space based on the trafo.
//
// 4. Assemble the PDE operator and the force to a matrix and a right-hand-side vector.
//
// 5. Assemble the boundary conditions to a filter.
//
// 6. Solve the resulting linear system using a simple fire-and-forget solver.
//
// 7. Compute the L2- and H1-errors against the analytical reference solution.
//
// 8. Write the result to a VTK file for visual post-processing, if desired.

// We are using FEAT, so use the namespace here.
using namespace FEAT;

// We're opening a new namespace for our tutorial.
// The only reason for this is that some compilers may give us warnings about "shadowing" types
// otherwise -- this would not be dramatic, but somewhat annoying...
namespace Tutorial01
{
  // We start with a set of typedefs, which make up the basic configuration for this
  // tutorial application. The general idea of these typedefs is (1) to avoid typing and
  // (2) specialise FEAT to do, out of the many possibilities, only what we want to do in
  // this tutorial.

  // -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  // First, we need to specify what type of mesh and what type of finite element space we want
  // to use in this tutorial application. For this, FEAT uses a "template type nesting" approach,
  // in which have to define the corresponding classes by nesting them.

  // The first type that we need to choose is the "shape type" of the mesh, i.e. the type of
  // cells/elements that our mesh should contain. At this point, we implicitly also choose whether
  // this will be a 1D, 2D or 3D tutorial, depending on the dimension of the chosen shape-type.
  // There are 5 shape-types available in FEAT and for this tutorial we pick quadrilateral elements.

  //typedef Shape::Hypercube<1> ShapeType;  // 1D
  //typedef Shape::Triangle ShapeType;      // 2D, same as Shape::Simplex<2>
  typedef Shape::Quadrilateral ShapeType;   // 2D, same as Shape::Hypercube<2>
  //typedef Shape::Tetrahedron ShapeType;   // 3D, same as Shape::Simplex<3>
  //typedef Shape::Hexahedron ShapeType;    // 3D, same as Shape::Hypercube<3>

  // The next step in the "template type nesting" approach is the choice of a mesh class.
  // We want to employ a simple unstructured conformal mesh, which is implemented by the
  // "Geometry::ConformalMesh" class template. At this point, we have to pass the chosen
  // shape-type as the first template parameter to the class template.
  typedef Geometry::ConformalMesh<ShapeType> MeshType;

  // The next type that we will require later is the "mesh-part" type. Object of this class
  // are used to describe certain mesh regions of some interest, e.g. boundary regions of
  // the mesh that we want to use for the definition of some boundary conditions.
  // The corresponding class is the "Geometry::MeshPart" class template and its one and only
  // template parameter is the mesh type that we have just defined:
  typedef Geometry::MeshPart<MeshType> MeshPartType;

  // The next thing we need is a transformation that our finite element spaces should use.
  // The transformation is responsible for providing the "reference-to-real-cell" mapping
  // functionality that is used by both the finite element space as well as various assembly
  // algorithms. Currently, the only available transformation is the "standard" mapping,
  // which represents a first-order transformation. The corresponding class is the
  // "Trafo::Standard::Mapping" class template and its one and only template parameter is
  // the underlying mesh type that we have defined above:
  typedef Trafo::Standard::Mapping<MeshType> TrafoType;

  // Finally, as the last step of our "template type nesting" approach is the definition of
  // the actual finite element space(s). In this tutorial we want to stick with the simple
  // standard first-order H1-conforming Q1 (or P1) space, which is implemented by the
  // "Space::Lagrange1::Element" class template. This element family takes the transformation
  // type as the one and only template parameter:

  // Use the Lagrange-1 element (aka "Q1" or "P1", depending on whether ShapeType is a
  // simplex or a hypercube shape type):
  typedef Space::Lagrange1::Element<TrafoType> SpaceType;

  // Or you could also use the Lagrange-2 element (aka "Q2" or "P2") instead:
  //typedef Space::Lagrange2::Element<TrafoType> SpaceType;

  // Or you could also use the Lagrange-3 element (aka "Q3" or "P3") instead:
  //typedef Space::Lagrange3::Element<TrafoType> SpaceType;


  // Before we continue, let us recapitulate what we have defined so far:
  // Reading the previous "template type nesting" odyssey in a bottom-up manner show us that
  // "SpaceType" is a
  // - Lagrange-1 (Q1/P1) finite element space defined on a
  // - standard transformation mapping defined on a
  // - conformal (unstructured) mesh consisting of
  // - quadrilateral cells/elements

  // At this point, you maybe already have an idea why we use those typedefs:

  // We could simply change the "ShapeType" definition from "Shape::Quadrilateral" to, say,
  // "Shape::Tetrahedron" and "SpaceType" would automatically be switched from a 2D Q1 element
  // to the matching 3D P1 element! This type of modularity is a major ingredient when it
  // comes to writing truly multi-dimensional applications -- or in other (more fancy) words:
  // Write a 2D application and get the 3D version for free! Yay!

  // -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  // In the next part, we have to define the linear algebra container types (matrix, vector, filter)
  // that our tutorial will use. At first, it may seem confusing that we have to define a type for
  // vectors via some template typedefs instead of using "the almighty one-size-fits-all vector"
  // class. Again, the reason is modularity: FEAT has much more to offer than just the standard
  // types, although that is all that we want to consider in this tutorial.

  // First, we have to choose the "Memory-Data-Index" type triplet, which specifies the basic types
  // that our linear algebra containers will use for their elements.

  // The first one is the memory type: This "tag class" specifies in which type of memory our
  // matrices and vectors will operate. In this tutorial, we want to stick with the main memory,
  // which is simply the RAM that the CPU has access to. FEAT also supports linear algebra
  // containers which work on GPUs using CUDA, but this will be covered another time.
  typedef Mem::Main MemType;

  // The second type is the data type: This is simply the type of the matrix and vector elements,
  // which is typically the double-precision floating point type aka "double". FEAT also supports
  // other data types as single or even quadruple precision, but we want to avoid that for now.
  typedef double DataType;

  // The third type is the index type: This is used by various containers which also store arrays
  // of indices, such as the row-pointer and column-index arrays of the CSR matrix format.
  // In particular, any (sufficiently large) integer type will do, so we stick to the "Index" type,
  // which corresponds to "unsigned long" by default.
  typedef Index IndexType;


  // Based on the three memory, data and index typedefs, we can now define the vector type.
  // In this tutorial, we want to solve a simple scalar PDE, so we require just a "standard"
  // vector class, which is implemented by the "LAFEM::DenseVector" class template:
  typedef LAFEM::DenseVector<MemType, DataType, IndexType> VectorType;

  // Furthermore, for the discretised Poisson operator, we require a scalar sparse matrix type.
  // We choose the famous CSR format here, because it is pretty much standard for unstructured FEM:
  typedef LAFEM::SparseMatrixCSR<MemType, DataType, IndexType> MatrixType;

  // Finally, we need a filter. Filters are responsible for "enforcing" simple linear constraints
  // such as boundary conditions and are required by the linear solver framework. In this tutorial,
  // we have a scalar PDE with Dirichlet boundary conditions and for this type of problem, we
  // require a so-called "unit-filter":
  typedef LAFEM::UnitFilter<MemType, DataType, IndexType> FilterType;

  // That's it for the linear algebra types.

  // -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

  // Here's our tutorial's main function.
  void main(Index level)
  {
    // Okay, we have already defined the mesh, trafo and space types, so we can start our
    // actual tutorial code by creating those.

    std::cout << "Creating Mesh on Level " << level << "..." << std::endl;

    // In a "real-life" application, we would either read the mesh from an input file or call
    // some sort of mesh generator library/tool to create a mesh for us, but in this tutorial,
    // we want to stick with a more simple solution, especially to avoid dependencies on external
    // files, libraries or tools. Instead, we will use the "RefinedUnitCubeFactory", which will
    // (as the name suggests) generate a refined unit-square mesh for us.

    // First of all, create a mesh factory object representing a refined unit-square domain
    // and pass the desired refinement level to its constructor. The only purpose of this
    // "factory" object is to create a mesh for us and we will not need it anymore after that.
    Geometry::RefinedUnitCubeFactory<MeshType> mesh_factory(level);

    // Now create the actual mesh by using that factory:
    MeshType mesh(mesh_factory);

    // Furthermore, we require a mesh-part that represents the boundary of the mesh for the
    // assembly of Dirichlet boundary conditions later on. Again, this would typically come
    // from an external file or a mesh generator, but we stick to a more simple solution.
    // We will utilise the "BoundaryFactory", which will create a boundary mesh-part for a
    // given mesh. Note that this BoundaryFactory class works for any given input mesh and
    // not only for meshes created by the RefinedUnitCubeFactory.

    // Now let's create a boundary factory for our mesh.
    Geometry::BoundaryFactory<MeshType> boundary_factory(mesh);

    // And create the boundary mesh-part by using the factory.
    MeshPartType boundary(boundary_factory);

    // Voila, we now have a mesh and a corresponding boundary mesh-part.

    // Symbolic linear system assembly

    std::cout << "Allocating matrix and vectors..." << std::endl;

    // Now we need to perform the symbolic matrix assembly, i.e., the computation of the non-zero
    // sparsity pattern and the allocation of the internal matrix arrays. For this, we first create
    // an empty matrix and then call the SymbolicAssembler to create the matrix sparsity pattern:
    MatrixType matrix;
    Assembly::SymbolicAssembler::assemble_matrix_std1(matrix, space);

    // Note: The "1" at the end of the function name "assemble_matrix_std1" indicates that there
    // is only one finite element space involved in the assembly, i.e. the test- and trial-
    // spaces are identical. The symbolic assembler also provides a function named
    // "assemble_matrix_std2", which takes two (possibly different) finite element spaces as
    // test- and trial-spaces, but we're not going to use it for now. However, this is
    // required for more complex PDEs like, e.g., the Stokes equations.

    // Now that the matrix structure is assembled, we can easily create two vector objects
    // for the solution and the right-hand-side vector by the create_vector_l/r member function
    // of the matrix object. This member function creates a vector of the corresponding
    // type and dimension, so that the vector can acts as a left or right multiplicand
    // in a matrix-vector multiply operation. Our matrix is square, so it does not matter
    // whether we call 'create_vector_l' or 'create_vector_r' here:
    VectorType vec_sol = matrix.create_vector_r();
    VectorType vec_rhs = matrix.create_vector_l();

    // Okay, we now have a matrix and two vectors. The internal arrays of those object are
    // allocated, but their data arrays are still uninitialised (automatic initialisation is
    // not performed due to performance reasons). Before we can continue with the numerical
    // assembly, we first need to reset the matrix and data arrays, i.e. set all entries
    // to zero, which is done by calling the "format" function. This is required because the
    // assembly methods for the matrix and the right-hand-side work in an "additive" way, i.e.
    // the assembled operators/functionals are added onto the given matrix/vector, so we
    // have to start with a null-matrix/-vector.

    // Numerical assembly: matrix (bilinear forms)

    // Before we start assembling anything, we need create a cubature factory, which will be
    // used to generate cubature rules for integration.
    // There are several cubature rules available in FEAT, and a complete list can be queried
    // by compiling and executing the 'cub-list' tool in the 'tools' directory.
    // We choose the 'auto-degree:n' rule here, which will automatically choose an appropriate
    // cubature rule that can integrate polynomials up to degree n exactly. Some other possible
    // choices are also provided here, but commented out.
    Cubature::DynamicFactory cubature_factory(
      "auto-degree:5"          // automatic cubature rule for 5th degree polynomials

    std::cout << "Assembling right-hand-side vector..." << std::endl;

    // The assembly of right-hand-side vector follows pretty much the same generic structure.
    // We use the opportunity to explain how to prescribe systems with analytically-known solutions.

    // In this tutorial, we first choose a reference solution for our PDE and then assemble the
    // corresponding right-hand-side for our Poisson problem. We choose the "sine-bubble" function,
    // which is pre-defined as a 'common function' in the "analytic/common.hpp" header,
    // so we can use it here. The SineBubbleFunction is implemented for 1D, 2D and 3D, so we
    // need to specify the desired dimension, which we can obtain from the ShapeType definition:
    Analytic::Common::SineBubbleFunction<ShapeType::dimension> sol_function;

    // Next, we need a linear functional that can be applied onto test functions for our
    // right-hand-side vector. The sine-bubble is an eigenfunction of the Laplace operator,
    // so the corresponding right-hand-side function is the solution multiplied by 2*pi^2.
    // We could exploit this by simply using our solution function for the right-hand-side
    // assembly and passing the constant factor as a multiplier for our assembly method,
    // but we will instead use the pre-defined LaplaceFunctional wrapper, which will
    // compute the right-hand-side force for any given solution function based on its
    // second derivatives. The LaplaceFunctional requires the type of the solution function
    // as its one and only template parameter, so we use the decltype specifier here, which
    // returns the class type of its argument, so that we do not have to write that out again:
    Assembly::Common::LaplaceFunctional<decltype(sol_function)> force_functional(sol_function);

    // Solver set-up

    // For this tutorial, we stick to a simple PCG-SSOR solver.

    std::cout << "Solving linear system..." << std::endl;

    // First, we need to create a SSOR preconditioner. Most of the solver implementations
    // have corresponding 'Solver::new_***' functions, which take care of the nasty type deduction
    // process. The returned object is a 'std::shared_ptr<SolverType>', where 'SolverType' is
    // an instance of the actual solver class template with the corresponding template arguments
    // that are deducted from the input arguments of the following function call:
    auto precond = Solver::new_ssor_precond(matrix, filter);

    // Now we create a PCG solver and pass the preconditioner as an additional argument:

    // PCG is an iterative solver, so we want to enable plotting of the convergence process,
    // as otherwise our solver would not print anything to the console:
    solver->set_plot_mode(Solver::PlotMode::iter);

    // Set the maximum number of iterations to 1000:
    solver->set_max_iter(1000);

    // Next, we need to initialise the solver. During this call, the solver and all of its
    // sub-solvers and preconditioners allocate required temporary vectors, perform factorisation
    // and all the other stuff that our solvers need to do before they can actually start
    // solving anything.

    Solver::solve(*solver, vec_sol, vec_rhs, matrix, filter);

    // Once we do not require the solver anymore, we have to release it. This is done by calling
